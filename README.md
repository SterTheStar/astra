# Astra

Minimalist Minecraft server fork for educational purposes.

This project is a fork of a minimalist Minecraft server intended solely for testing and educational purposes. It is not functional for real gameplay and exists only to explore concepts and experiment.

* Minecraft version: `1.21.8`
* Protocol version: `772`

## Configuration

The server can be configured via the `astra-settings.ini` file. An example configuration looks like this:

```
port=25565
view_distance=8
worldgen_mode=0  # 0 = default generation, 1 = flat world
motd=Astra Server
```

You can adjust the port, view distance, world generation mode, and server MOTD by editing this file.
